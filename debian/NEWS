offlineimap (7.0.5+dfsg1-0.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  OfflineIMAP is starting a new major release cycle.

  The dabatase for the cache is now sqlite by default. This means downgrading to
  previous versions is prone to errors if you don't have sqlite enabled in your
  configuration. All users should enable the sqlite database now to avoid issues.
  Expect the legacy text files to be deprecated and removed in the future.

  The long time awaited feature to not delete any message while allowing adding
  new messages and sync flags is now implemented and marked stable. Thanks to the
  testers and your feedbacks!

  Summary of important changes:

  - Passwords are now expected in Unicode almost everywhere. They are used with
    the UTF-8 charset. However, some configuration options are not UTF-8 friendly
    mostly because of library limitations (e.g.: `remotepass`).

    Users with Unicode caracters in the passwords are recommended to use a file or
    `remotepasseval`.

  - The sqlite database is the default.

    Please, read [this blog post]({% post_url 2016-05-19-sqlite-becomes-default %}).

  - The PID file is no longer used because offlineimap is able to run multiple
    instances.

offlineimap (6.7.0+dfsg1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  OfflineIMAP version 6.3.5 introduced a regression by changing the FMD5
  part of a message's filename. This may cause a complete re-upload of all
  local emails, since OfflineIMAP believes that all the messages have been
  removed and adds them back.

  In case you are upgrading from a version older than 6.3.5, you may need
  to use the '--migrate-fmd5-using-nametrans' option in order to migrate
  the FMD5 hashes.

offlineimap (6.6.0~rc3+dfsg1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  OfflineIMAP has now SSL enabled by default to prevent sending private
  data in clear. The 'maxage' feature has also been removed for IMAP-to-IMAP
  sync since it was broken. Instead, a new option (named 'startdate') has
  been introduced, designed for IMAP/IMAP setups only.

  As for the Debian package, OfflineIMAP is now treated as a Python
  application (i.e., its modules are private) and uses the python-imaplib2
  package instead of an embedded copy.

  offlineimap.conf:
  * SSL certificate fingerprints are now actually verified. You may want
    to use provide correct fingerprints or use Debian SSL CA
    certifications for Remote repository validation with the
    following option:
    `sslcacertfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`
  * createfolders (Default: True) enables creating folders in a
    repository, and can be set to False to disable the propagation of new
    folders to the new repository. See sample offlineimap.conf.
  * Notices added that '%' needs to be encoded as '%%'

offlineimap (6.5.3.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  Reverse nametrans
  +++++++++++++++++
  
    Starting with v6.4.0, OfflineImap supports the creation of folders on the
    remote repostory. This change means that people that only had a
    nametrans option on the remote repository (everyone) will need to have a
    nametrans setting on the local repository too that will reverse the name
    transformation. 

    For further information, see documentation about this feature at:

      file:///usr/share/doc/offlineimap/html/nametrans.html#reverse-nametrans
