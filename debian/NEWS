offlineimap (6.7.0+dfsg1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  OfflineIMAP version 6.3.5 introduced a regression by changing the FMD5
  part of a message's filename. This may cause a complete re-upload of all
  local emails, since OfflineIMAP believes that all the messages have been
  removed and adds them back.

  In case you are upgrading from a version older than 6.3.5, you may need
  to use the '--migrate-fmd5-using-nametrans' option in order to migrate
  the FMD5 hashes.

offlineimap (6.6.0~rc3+dfsg1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  OfflineIMAP has now SSL enabled by default to prevent sending private
  data in clear. The 'maxage' feature has also been removed for IMAP-to-IMAP
  sync since it was broken. Instead, a new option (named 'startdate') has
  been introduced, designed for IMAP/IMAP setups only.

  As for the Debian package, OfflineIMAP is now treated as a Python
  application (i.e., its modules are private) and uses the python-imaplib2
  package instead of an embedded copy.

  * createfolders (Default: True) enables creating folders in a
    repository, and can be set to False to disable the propagation of new
    folders to the new repository. See sample offlineimap.conf.

  Reverse nametrans
  +++++++++++++++++
  
    Starting with v6.4.0, OfflineImap supports the creation of folders on the
    remote repostory. This change means that people that only had a
    nametrans option on the remote repository (everyone) will need to have a
    nametrans setting on the local repository too that will reverse the name
    transformation. 

    For further information, see documentation about this feature at:

      file:///usr/share/doc/offlineimap/html/nametrans.html#reverse-nametrans
